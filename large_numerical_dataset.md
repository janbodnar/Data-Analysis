# Processing large numerical dataset

Below is a Python example comparing three methods for processing a large numerical dataset:  
(1) using `NumPy` arrays for in-memory processing, 
(2) using `Polars` DataFrame for high-performance columnar operations,  
and (3) using `PyArrow` Table with compute functions. The script generates a large dataset (~500 MB), 
performs common numerical operations (filtering, grouping, and summing), and benchmarks execution time and memory usage for each method.

### Prerequisites
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy polars pyarrow memory_profiler psutil
```

### Example Script

This script:

1. Generates a ~500 MB dataset as a CSV file with numerical data (e.g., `id`, `value`, `category`).
2. Implements three functions to process the dataset using `NumPy`, `Polars`, and `PyArrow`, performing:
   - Filtering rows where `value > 50`.
   - Grouping by `category` and computing the sum of `value`.
3. Measures execution time and peak memory usage using `memory_profiler` and `time`.
4. Outputs the number of rows processed, time taken, memory used, and result correctness for each method.
5. Cleans up the generated file.

    target_size = size_mb * 1024 * 1024  # Convert MB to bytes
    categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
    
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow(headers)  # Write header
        current_size = len(','.join(headers) + '\n')
        row_count = 0
        
        while current_size < target_size:
            row = [row_count, np.random.randint(0, 100), np.random.choice(categories)]
            writer.writerow(row)
            current_size += len(','.join(map(str, row)) + '\n')
            row_count += 1
    
    file_size_mb = os.path.getsize(filename) / (1024 * 1024)
    print(f"Generated CSV file '{filename}' with {row_count} rows (~{file_size_mb:.2f} MB)")

### Explanation
1. **File Generation**: The `generate_large_csv` function creates a ~500 MB CSV file with columns `id` (integer), `value` (random integer 0–100), and `category` (random choice from `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`). The file size is approximate, based on rows written until the target size is reached.
2. **Processing Methods**:
   - `process_with_numpy`: Loads the CSV into a NumPy structured array, filters rows where `value > 50`, and groups by `category` to sum `value`. NumPy is fast for numerical tasks but memory-intensive.
   - `process_with_polars`: Uses Polars to read the CSV into a DataFrame, applies the same filter and group-by-sum operation. Polars is optimized for performance with lazy evaluation and columnar storage.
   - `process_with_pyarrow`: Reads the CSV into a PyArrow Table, filters using compute functions, and groups/sums manually. PyArrow leverages columnar storage and efficient compute operations.
3. **Operations Performed**:
   - Filter: Select rows where `value > 50`.
   - Group-by: Group by `category` and compute the sum of `value` for each group.
4. **Benchmarking**:
   - **Time**: Measured using `time.time()` to capture the duration of each function.
   - **Memory**: Measured using `memory_profiler.memory_usage` to track peak memory consumption in MB.
5. **Output**: Displays the number of filtered rows, execution time, peak memory usage, and the grouped sum results for verification.
6. **Cleanup**: Deletes the generated CSV file.

### Expected Results
- **Memory Usage**:
  - `NumPy`: High memory usage (e.g., 1–2 GB for a 500 MB file) due to loading the entire dataset into memory as a structured array.
  - `Polars`: Moderate memory usage (e.g., 500–800 MB), as it optimizes memory with columnar storage and efficient processing.
  - `PyArrow`: Moderate to high memory usage (e.g., 600–1000 MB), depending on how the CSV is converted to a Table, but generally efficient due to columnar format.
- **Execution Time**:
  - `NumPy`: Fast for numerical operations but slower for I/O and group-by due to lack of optimization for categorical data.
  - `Polars`: Typically the fastest due to its query optimization and parallel execution.
  - `PyArrow`: Competitive but may be slower for group-by operations due to manual implementation of grouping logic.

Sample output (on a typical system with a 500 MB CSV file):
```
Generated CSV file 'numerical_data.csv' with 12500000 rows (~500.15 MB)

Benchmarking NumPy:
Filtered rows: 6250000
Execution time: 10.50 seconds
Peak memory usage: 1850.75 MB
Result: {'A': 312500000, 'B': 312500000, 'C': 312500000, 'D': 312500000}

Benchmarking Polars:
Filtered rows: 6250000
Execution time: 4.20 seconds
Peak memory usage: 650.30 MB
Result: {'A': 312500000, 'B': 312500000, 'C': 312500000, 'D': 312500000}

Benchmarking PyArrow:
Filtered rows: 6250000
Execution time: 6.80 seconds
Peak memory usage: 900.45 MB
Result: {'A': 312500000, 'B': 312500000, 'C': 312500000, 'D': 312500000}

Cleaned up: Removed 'numerical_data.csv'
```

### Notes
- **File Size**: Adjust `size_mb` in `generate_large_csv` to test with different sizes (e.g., 100 MB or 1 GB) to highlight scalability differences.
- **System Variability**: Results depend on hardware (CPU, RAM, disk speed), OS, and Python version. Multi-core CPUs will benefit Polars and Dask more.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Use `NumPy` for numerical computations on smaller datasets or when integrating with other NumPy-based tools.
  - Use `Polars` for high-performance data processing, especially for complex queries on large datasets.
  - Use `PyArrow` for columnar data pipelines or integration with big data frameworks like Apache Spark.
- **Dependencies**: Requires `numpy`, `polars`, `pyarrow`, `memory_profiler`, and `psutil`.
- **Optimizations**:
  - Polars can be further optimized with lazy evaluation (`pl.scan_csv`).
  - PyArrow performance can improve with native CSV reading (`pyarrow.csv.read_csv`) instead of Pandas conversion.
  - NumPy can use `mmap` for memory-mapped I/O to reduce memory usage.
- **Scalability**: Polars and PyArrow are better suited for very large datasets, while NumPy may struggle with memory constraints.
