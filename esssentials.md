# Essentials of Efficient Data Handling in Python

This tutorial introduces the basics of handling data efficiently in Python, focusing
on iterators, generators, and reading data. These concepts are critical for managing
large datasets with minimal memory usage.

## 1. Understanding Iterators

Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse a collection (like a list) one item
at a time, without loading the entire collection into memory. They are memory-
efficient and foundational for efficient data processing.

### 1.1 What is an Iterator?

An iterator implements two methods: `__iter__` (returns the iterator object) and
`__next__` (returns the next item). Python’s built-in `iter()` and `next()` functions
use these methods.

**Example: Creating and Using an Iterator**

```python
# Create a list and its iterator
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
iterator = iter(numbers)

# Iterate using next()
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3

# Iterate using a loop
for num in iterator:
    print(num)  # Output: 4, 5
```

**Explanation:** The iterator yields one item at a time, reducing memory overhead
compared to accessing the entire list at once. When exhausted, it raises a
`StopIteration` exception.

### 1.2 Why Use Iterators?

Iterators are ideal for large datasets because they process data lazily, only loading
the current item into memory. This is crucial when working with files or streams.

## 2. Generators for Memory Efficiency

Generators are a special type of iterator that simplify creating iterators using the
`yield` keyword. They generate values on-the-fly, making them extremely memory-
efficient for large or infinite sequences.

### 2.1 Creating a Generator

Use the `yield` keyword in a function to create a generator. Each call to `yield`
produces a value, pausing the function until the next value is requested.

**Example: Generator for Fibonacci Sequence**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Use the generator
for num in fibonacci(6):
    print(num)  # Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```

**Explanation:** The generator yields Fibonacci numbers one at a time, storing only
the current state (`a`, `b`) in memory, unlike a list that stores all values.

### 2.2 Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are a concise way to create generators, similar to list
comprehensions but using parentheses.

**Example: Generator Expression**

```python
# List comprehension (stores all values)
squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(1000)]

# Generator expression (yields values one at a time)
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(1000))

# Compare memory usage
import sys
print(f"List memory: {sys.getsizeof(squares_list)} bytes")
print(f"Generator memory: {sys.getsizeof(squares_gen)} bytes")

# Use generator
print(next(squares_gen))  # Output: 0
print(next(squares_gen))  # Output: 1
```

**Output:**
```
List memory: 8856 bytes
Generator memory: 112 bytes
```

**Explanation:** The generator expression uses minimal memory because it doesn’t
store the sequence, only yielding values as needed.

## 3. Reading Data Efficiently

Efficiently reading data from files is critical for large datasets. Avoid loading
entire files into memory; instead, process data iteratively.

### 3.1 Reading Files Line by Line

Python’s file objects are iterators, allowing you to read lines one at a time.

**Example: Reading a File Line by Line**

```python
# Simulate a text file
with open('data.txt', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(1000):
        f.write(f"Line {i}\n")

# Read file line by line
with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())  # Output: Line 0, Line 1, ...
        break  # Stop after one line for demo
```

**Explanation:** Reading line by line keeps only the current line in memory, ideal
for large files. The `strip()` method removes trailing newlines.

### 3.2 Using Generators to Read Files

Create a generator to yield processed data from a file, combining file reading with
custom logic.

**Example: Generator for CSV File**

```python
import csv

# Simulate a CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'w') as f:
    f.write('id,name\n1,Alice\n2,Bob\n3,Charlie\n')

# Generator to yield CSV rows
def read_csv_rows(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        header = next(reader)  # Skip header
        for row in reader:
            yield row

# Use the generator
for row in read_csv_rows('data.csv'):
    print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}")  # Output: ID: 1, Name: Alice, ...
```

**Explanation:** The generator yields one CSV row at a time, minimizing memory use
while allowing flexible processing.

## 4. Practical Example: Processing Large Logs

Combine iterators, generators, and file reading to process a large log file
efficiently.

**Example: Counting Errors in a Log File**

```python
# Simulate a log file
with open('logs.txt', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(1000):
        status = 'ERROR' if i % 100 == 0 else 'INFO'
        f.write(f"[{status}] Event {i}\n")

# Generator to yield error lines
def get_errors(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            if 'ERROR' in line:
                yield line.strip()

# Count errors
error_count = sum(1 for _ in get_errors('logs.txt'))
print(f"Number of errors: {error_count}")  # Output: Number of errors: 10
```

**Explanation:** The generator `get_errors` yields only lines containing 'ERROR',
keeping memory usage low. The `sum` function counts occurrences efficiently using a
generator expression.

## 5. Best Practices for Efficient Data Handling

- **Use Iterators for Large Collections:** Prefer `iter()` and `next()` for memory-
  efficient traversal.
- **Leverage Generators:** Use `yield` or generator expressions for sequences that
  don’t need to be stored in memory.
- **Read Files Iteratively:** Process files line by line or in chunks to handle
  large datasets.
- **Profile Memory Usage:** Use `sys.getsizeof()` to monitor memory consumption and
  optimize accordingly.
- **Combine Tools:** Integrate iterators and generators with libraries like `csv`
  for robust data processing.

## Conclusion

Mastering iterators, generators, and efficient file reading is essential for
handling data in Python, especially for large datasets. These tools enable memory-
efficient processing, setting the foundation for scaling to millions or billions of
rows with libraries like Pandas and Dask.
